### INTRODUCTION
The skin is the largest organ in the human body, consisting of the epidermis, dermis, subcutaneous tissues, blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, nerves, and muscles.
Skin can enhance its barrier function by preventing lipid degradation in the epidermis with the use of a liquid. Fungal growth on the skin, latent microorganisms,
allergic reactions, germs modifying the skin's texture, or microbes producing pigment can all lead to skin illnesses. Chronic skin diseases can occasionally develop
into malignant tissues. Skin diseases need to be treated right away to stop them from spreading further. Nowadays, there is a major need for research on methods based
on imaging technology to determine the consequences of various skin diseases. Many skin conditions have symptoms that may require a lot of work to address because the
conditions might progress for months before a diagnosis is made. The generalization capacity of medical specialists in previous dermatological computer-aided categorization
work has been lacking due to a paucity of data and a concentration on standardized tasks like dermoscopy, which is the examination of the skin using skin surface microscopy.
With computer-aided diagnosis, skin illnesses can be effectively and consistently categorized so that patients can be prescribed medication based on their symptoms. 
This work proposes a robust method that, by using supervisory approaches that reduce diagnosis costs, may accurately diagnose skin illnesses.
